Building Downstream Applications
================================

ADAM is packaged so that it can be used interactively via the ADAM
shell, called from the command line interface (CLI), or included as a
library when building downstream applications.

This document covers three patterns for building applications downstream
of ADAM:

-  Extend the ADAM CLI by `adding new commands <cli.html#extend-the-adam-cli-by-adding-new-commands>`__
-  Extend the ADAM CLI by `adding new commands in an external repository <cli.html#extend-the-adam-cli-by-adding-new-commands-in-an-external-repository>`__
-  Use ADAM as a `library in new applications <library.html#use-adam-as-a-library-in-new-applications>`__
