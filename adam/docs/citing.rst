Citing ADAM
===========

ADAM has been described in two manuscripts. The first,
`a tech report <https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2013/EECS-2013-207.pdf>`__,
came out in 2013 and described the rationale behind using schemas for genomics,
and presented an early implementation of some of the preprocessing algorithms.

The second,
`a conference paper <http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?ftid=1586788&id=2742787)>`__,
appeared in the SIGMOD 2015 Industrial Track. This paper described how ADAM's
design was influenced by database systems, expanded upon the concept of a stack
architecture for scientific analyses, presented more results comparing ADAM to
state-of-the-art single node genomics tools, and demonstrated how the
architecture generalized beyond genomics.

We prefer that you cite both papers, but if you can only cite one paper, we
prefer that you cite the SIGMOD 2015 manuscript.
